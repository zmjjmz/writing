This project could not have been completed so quickly and thoroughly without the invaluable help from the rest of the IBEIS team.
I would like to thank Jon Crall for helping to write the experimentation framework which has saved a lot of time and effort.
I would also like to thank Jason Parham and Hendrik Weidemann for the great discussions and advice, as well as the handy \LaTeX template. 
Additionally, without the development and annotation efforts of Andrew Batbouta, a lot of models could not have been so successfully trained. 
Importantly, I would like to thank the Wildbook team (Jason Holmberg, Jon van Oast) for providing the dataset and corresponding annotations with which a lot of models were trained and experiments run. 
Of course, this work could never have been undertaken without the help, advice, and direction of my advisor, Charles Stewart.
